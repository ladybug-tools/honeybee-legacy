"""
Use this component to create a custom material for glass, which can be plugged into the "Honeybee_EnergyPlus Construction" component.
_
It is important to note that this component creates a material that represents a single pane of glass, which can be combined with the "Honeybee_EnergyPlus Window Air Gap" to make multi-pane windows.  If you have specifications for a whole window element and not individual panes of glass and gas, you are better-off using the "Honeybee_EnergyPlus Window Material" component

Provided by Honeybee 0.0.63
    
    Args:
        _name: A text name for your glass material.
        thickness_: A number that represents the thickness of the pane of glass in meters.  The default is set to 0.003 meters (3 mm).
        solarTransmittance_: A number between 0 and 1 that represents the transmittance of solar radiation through the glass at normal incidence.  The default is set to 0.837, which it typical for clear glass without a low-e coating.
        solarReflectance_: A number between 0 and 1 that represents the reflectance of solar radiation off the glass at normal incidence.  The default is set to 0.075, which is typical for clear glass without a low-e coating.
        visibleTransmittance_: A number between 0 and 1 that represents the transmittance of only visible light through the glass at normal incidence.  This is usally very close to the solarTransmittance_ for non-low-e-coated glass but can differ if the glass has a low-e coating. The default is set to 0.898, which is typical for clear glass without a low-e coating.
        visibleReflectance_: A number between 0 and 1 that represents the reflectance of only visible light off the glass at normal incidence.  This is usally very close to the solarReflectance_ for non-low-e-coated glass but can differ if the glass has a low-e coating. The default is set to 0.081, which is typical for clear glass without a low-e coating.
        frontEmissivity_:  A number between 0 and 1 that represents the infrared hemispherical emissivity of the front (outdoor-facing) side of the glass.  This number is usually pretty high for non-low-e-coated glass but can be significantly lower for low-e coated glass.  The default is set to 0.84, which is typical for clear glass without a low-e coating.
        backEmissivity_:  A number between 0 and 1 that represents the infrared hemispherical emissivity of the back (indoor-facing) side of the glass.  This number is usually pretty high for non-low-e-coated glass but can be significantly lower for low-e coated glass.  The default is set to 0.84, which is typical for clear glass without a low-e coating.
        conductivity_:  A number representing the conductivity of the glass in W/m-K. The default is set to 0.9, which is typical for clear glass without a low-e coating.
    Returns:
        EPMaterial: A glass material that can be plugged into the "Honeybee_EnergyPlus Construction" component.
