    Args:
        _cnstrName: EnergyPlus construction name

    Returns:
        materials: List of materials (from outside to inside)
        comments: Comments for each layer of materials if any
        UValue_SI: U-value of the construction in W/m2-K.  Note that this U-value does not include the resistance of air films on either side of the construction and this resistance is typically included in U-values used by manufacturers.  Use the "Honeybee_R-Value With Air Films" component to account for these air films.
        UValue_IP: U-value of the construction in Btu/hft2F.  Note that this U-value does not include the resistance of air films on either side of the construction and this resistance is typically included in U-values used by manufacturers.  Use the "Honeybee_R-Value With Air Films" component to account for these air films.
        RValue_SI: R-value of the construction in m2-K/W.
        RValue_IP: R-value of the construction in hft2F/Btu.
