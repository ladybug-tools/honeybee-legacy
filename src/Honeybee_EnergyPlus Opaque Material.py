"""
Use this component to create a custom opaque material, which can be plugged into the "Honeybee_EnergyPlus Construction" component.
_
This component requires you to know a lot of the characteristics of the material and, you may want to borrow some characteristcs of a similar material in the library.  Use the "Honeybee_Call From EP Construction Library" and the "Honeybee_Decompose EP Material" to help with this.
_
If you are not able to find all of the necessary material characteristcs and your desired material is relatively light, it might be easier for you to use a "Honeybee_EnergyPlus NoMass Opaque Material."

Provided by Honeybee 0.0.62
    
    Args:
        _name: A text name for your Opaque Material.
        _roughness_: A text value that indicated the roughness of your material.  This can be either "VeryRough", "Rough", "MediumRough", "MediumSmooth", "Smooth", and "VerySmooth".  The default is set to "Rough".
        _thickness: A number that represents the thickness of the material in meters (m).
        _conductivity:  A number representing the conductivity of the material in W/m-K.  This is essentially the heat flow in Watts across one meter thick of the material when the temperature difference on either side is 1 Kelvin.
        _density:  A number representing the density of the material in kg/m3.  This is essentially the mass one cubic meter of the material.
        _specificHeat:  A number representing the specific heat capacity of the material in J/kg-K.  This is essentially the number of joules needed to raise one kg of the material by 1 degree Kelvin.
        _thermAbsp_: An number between 0 and 1 that represents the thermal abstorptance of the material.  The default is set to 0.9, which is common for most non-metallic materials.
        _solAbsp_: An number between 0 and 1 that represents the abstorptance of solar radiation by the material.  The default is set to 0.7, which is common for most non-metallic materials.
        _visAbsp_: An number between 0 and 1 that represents the abstorptance of visible light by the material.  The default is set to 0.7, which is common for most non-metallic materials.
    Returns:
        EPMaterial: An opaque material that can be plugged into the "Honeybee_EnergyPlus Construction" component.
