"""
Use this component to create a custom opaque material that has no mass, which can be plugged into the "Honeybee_EnergyPlus Construction" component.
_
It is important to note that this component creates a material with no mass and, because of this, the accuracy of the component is not as great as a material that has mass.  However, this component is very useful if you only have an R-value for a material (or a construction) and you know that the mass is relatively small.
_
If you want to create a material that accounts for mass, you should use the "Honeybee_EnergyPlus Window Material" component.

    Args:
        _name: A text name for your NoMass Opaque Material.
        _roughness_: A text value that indicated the roughness of your material.  This can be either "VeryRough", "Rough", "MediumRough", "MediumSmooth", "Smooth", and "VerySmooth".  The default is set to "Rough".
        _R-Value: A number representing the R-Value of the material in m2-K/W.
        _thermAbsp_: An number between 0 and 1 that represents the thermal abstorptance of the material.  The default is set to 0.9, which is common for most non-metallic materials.
        _solAbsp_: An number between 0 and 1 that represents the abstorptance of solar radiation by the material.  The default is set to 0.7, which is common for most non-metallic materials.
        _visAbsp_: An number between 0 and 1 that represents the abstorptance of visible light by the material.  The default is set to 0.7, which is common for most non-metallic materials.
    Returns:
        EPMaterial: A no-mass opaque material that can be plugged into the "Honeybee_EnergyPlus Construction" component.
