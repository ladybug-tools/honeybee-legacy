"""
Use this component to create a THERM boundary condition.
-
Provided by Honeybee 0.0.59

    Args:
        _boundaryCurve: A polyline or list of polylines that coincide with the thermPolygons that you plan to connect to the "Write Therm File" component.
        _name: An name for the boundary condition to keep track of it through the creation of the THERM model.  If no value is input here, a default unique name will be generated.
        _temperature: A numerical value that represents the temperature at the boundary in degrees Celcius.
        _filmCoefficient: Either a numerical value in W/m2-K that represents the conductivity of the air film at the boundary condition or simply input the word 'indoor' or 'outdoor' to have the film coefficient autocalculated based on the position of geometry in the Rhino scene and an interpolation of values from Table 10 from chapter 26 of ASHRAE Fundementals 2013:
            _
            Typical film coefficient values range from 26 W/m2-K (for an NFRC exterior envelope) to 2.5 W/m2-K (for an interior wood/vinyl surface).
            _
            Note that, when inputting 'outdoor', the component will assume an outdoor wind speed of 3.4 m/s (22.7 W/m2-K) and, for higher wind speeds, higher film coefficients should be input (ie. 6.7 m/s = 34.0 W/m2-K).
        emissivity_: An optional number between 0 and 1 to set an override for the emissivity along the boundary.  By default, the Grasshopper components will take the emissivity of the material that is adjacent to the boundary.  However, a value here can over-ride this value to account for coatings like those on Low-E glass or matte paint on metallic materials.
        uFactorTag_: An optional text string to define a U-Factor tag for the boundary condition.  U-Factor tags are used tell THERM the boundary on which you would like to compute a U-Value.  The default is set to to have no U-Factor tag.  This input can be any text string.  For example "Frame", "Edge", or "Spacer."
        RGBColor_: An optional color to set the color of the boundary condition when you import it into THERM.
    Returns:
        readMe!:...
        thermBoundary: A polyline with the specified boudary condition properties, to be plugged into the "boundaries" input of the "Write Therm File" component.
