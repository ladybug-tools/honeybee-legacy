"""
Use this component to create a custom material for a window air gap, which can be plugged into the "Honeybee_EnergyPlus Construction" component.
_
It is important to note that this component only creates gaps of air and not other gasses.
Also, the material out of this component represents only a single layer of air, which can be combined with the "Honeybee_EnergyPlus Glass Material" to make multi-pane windows.
If you have specifications for a whole window element and not individual panes of glass and gas, you are better-off using the "Honeybee_EnergyPlus Window Material" component instead of this one.

-
Provided by Honeybee 0.0.63
    
    Args:
        _name: A text name for your window air gap material.
        _thickness_: A number that represents the thickness of the air gap in meters.  The default is set to 0.0125 meters (1.25 cm).
    Returns:
        EPMaterial: A window air gap material that can be plugged into the "Honeybee_EnergyPlus Construction" component.
