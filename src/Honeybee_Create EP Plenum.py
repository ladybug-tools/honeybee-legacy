"""
Use this component to turn a HBZone into a 'Plenum Zone' with no internal loads.  This is useful to appropriately assign conditions for closets, underfloor spaces, and drop ceilings.
-
Provided by Honeybee 0.0.62

    Args:
        _HBZones: HBZones that you want to turn into plenum zones.
        conditioned_: Set to 'True' if the plenum is active or is conditioned and set to 'False' to have the plenum be unconditioned.  The default is set to 'False' to have the zones unconditioned.
    Returns:
        HBZPlenumZones: HBZones that have had their loads dropped to 0 to be reflective of plenum zones.
