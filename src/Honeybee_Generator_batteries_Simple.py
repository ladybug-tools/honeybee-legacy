    Args:
        No_battery: To form a battery bank of a particularly battery enter the number of the batteries in the bank as an integer here the default is one.
        name_: The battery name 
        battery_capacity: The capacity of each battery in joules
        initial_charge: The intitial charge of the batteries as a fraction 
        max_discharge: The maximum discharge rate in Watts
        max_charge: The maximum charge rate in Watts
        discharge_n: The discharging efficiency the default value is 0.7
        charge_n: The charging efficiency the default value is 0.7
        battery_cost: The cost of each battery (The total battery cost will equal this value multipled by the number of batteries) in whatever currency the user wishes - Just make it consistent with other components you are using
        
    Returns:
        HB_batteries: Honeybee batteries - to include these batteries in a generation system connect them to the input HB_generationobjects on the Honeybee_generationsystem component
