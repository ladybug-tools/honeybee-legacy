Provided by Honeybee 0.0.62
    
    Args:
        _skyFilePath: Path to a radiance sky file
        _imageSize_: Optional input for size of the imgae in pixles. Default value is 500 px
        _runIt: Set to true to run the analysis
    Returns:
        HDRImagePath: Path to the result HDR file
        globalHorIrradiance: Global horizontal irradiance for an upstructed test point under this sky (wh/m2) - In case you're watching the cumulative sky the number is in (KWh/m2).
