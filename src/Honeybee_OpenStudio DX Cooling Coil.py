    Args:
        _dxCoilSpeed:...0 = 1 speed, 1 = 2 speed
        _name:...provide a unique coil for each one that you use

        _availabilitySchedule_:... an OpenStudio or Honeybee can be plugged in here to limit the availability of the cooling coil.
        _ratedHighSpeedTotalCooling_: ...This value is typically blank, it can be autosized (the Units are in Watts)/
        _ratedHighSpeedSensibleHeatRatio_: ... This value is typically blank.  Its value must be between 0 and 1.  
        _ratedHighSpeedCOP_: ... the efficiency at design conditions for the DX coil
        _ratedLowSpeedTotalCooling_ ... This value is typically blank, it can be autosized (the Units are in Watts)/
        _ratedLowSpeedSensibleHeatRatio_ ...This value is typically blank.  Its value must be between 0 and 1.  
        _ratedLowSpeedCOP ... the efficiency at design conditions for the DX coil
        _condenserType ... 0 = air cooled (default), 1 is evaporatively cooled
        _evaporativeCondenserDescription_ ... if the condenserType is evaporative cooled, provide a description of the evap unit.  This can be imported from the Honeybee component for evaporative condensers.
        _Curves_ ... Not yet implemented.  Allows you to specify custom part load curves for DX coils.
        _unitInternalStaticPressure_ ... (units are Pascals).  This item is rarely used, but helps to calculate EER and IEER for variable speed DX systems.  Refers to the total internal pressure of the air handler.
    Returns:
        DXCoil:...return DX coil definition
