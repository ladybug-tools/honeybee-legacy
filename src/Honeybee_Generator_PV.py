Use this component to add Energy Plus Photovoltaic generators to a Honeybee Surface, at present only Photovoltaic generators with Simple Photovoltaicperformance objects are supported. Only one Photovoltaic generator can be mounted on each surface.
For more information about Photovolatic generators please see page 1813 of the EnergyPlus input output reference at:
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/pdfs/inputoutputreference.pdf

    Args:
        _HBSurfaces: A Honeybee/context surface or a list of Honeybee/context surfaces to which one Photovolatic generator will be mounted on each surface.
        name_: An optional input, a name or a list of names of PV generators which correspond sequentially to the _HBSurfaces. Without this input PV generators will be assigned default names.
        SA_solarcells: A float or a list of floats as fraction of the fraction of the Honeybee surfaces, in the field above that are covered with Photovoltaics.
        cells_n: A float or a list of floats as a fraction of the efficiency of the Photovoltaic generator cells which correspond sequentially to _HBSurfaces.
        _integrationmode: EnergyPlus allows for different ways of integrating with other EnergyPlus heat transfer surfaces and models and calculating Photovoltaic cell temperature. This field is a integer or a list of integers sequentially to _HBSurfaces between 1 and 6 that defines the heat transfer integration mode used in the calculations as one of the following options. Decoupled a value of 1, DecoupledUllebergDynamic a value of 2, IntegratedSurfaceOutsideFace a value of 3, IntegratedTranspiredCollector a value of 4, IntegratedExteriorVentedCavity a value of 5, PhotovoltaicThermalSolarCollector a value of 6. The default is 1 the Decoupled mode. More information about each mode can be found on page 1767 and 1768 of the Energyplus Input Output reference.
        No_parallel: A integer or a list of integers sequentially to _HBSurfaces thats defines the series-wired strings of PV modules that are in parallel to form the PV generator on the surface. The product of this field and the next field will equal the total number of modules in the PV generator
        No_series: A integer or a list of integers sequentially to _HBSurfaces thats defines number of modules wired in series (on each string) to form the PV generator on the surface. The product of this field and the previous field will equal the total number of modules in the PV generator.
    Returns:
        PV_HBSurfaces: The Honeybee/context surfaces that have been modified by this component - these surfaces now contain PV generators to run in an Energy Plus simulation connect them to the HBContext_ input of the Honeybee_ Run Energy Simulation component to run in an EnergyPlus simulation.
