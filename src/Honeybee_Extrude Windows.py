"""
Extrude pseudo walls from window polygons. This component has only been tested with rectangular windows.

-
Provided by Honeybee 0.0.61
    

    Args:
        _glazings: Any number of glazing polygons.
        _thickness: Thickness of the window. Can be a single number or a list of numbers. If its a list then the list should be equal to the number of glazings.
    Returns:
        windowExtrusions: Geometric representations of glazing walls.
