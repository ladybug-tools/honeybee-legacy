"""
    This component is to be used for specifying the location of luminaires for electric lighting simulations.
    -
    For external lighting applications the best option would be to use the aimingPoint_ option to specify where all the luminaires should be aimed to.
    In case luminaires are being aimed by specifying spin, tilt and orientation angles, the following conventions apply:
        1. _spin_ : specifies the rotation of a luminaire about its G0 axis.
        2. _tilt_: species the rotation of a luminaire around the Y axis.
        3. _orientation_: specifies the rotation of a luminaire around the Z axis.
    The recommended sequence of applying rotations is tilt,orientation and spin. 
    _
    The aiming conventions followed in this component are based on the IES LM-63-2002 and were tested against indoor lighting simulations with AGI32 software.


    Args:
        _ptsList: List of points/3d coordinates where the luminaires are to be located.
        _spin_: Luminaire spin angle. 
        _tilt_: Luminaire tilt angle.
        _orientation_: Luminaire rotation angle.
        aimingPoint_: Location at which the photometric axis of each luminaire should be aimed.
        customLamp_: Specify a custom lamp using the IES Custom Lamp component
    Returns:
        luminaireZone: List of coordinates and rotation angles for luminaires
        locations: List of luminaire coordinates alone. This output can be used for previewing luminaire locations.
