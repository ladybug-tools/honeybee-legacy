Airside Economizer
-
Provided by Honeybee 0.0.57

    Args:
        _uniqueName : a required field to uniquely name the economizer
        _economizerControlType_:... requires an integer specifying the type of economizer 0:FixedDryBulb(default),1:DifferentialDryBulb,2:FixedEnthalpy,3:DifferentialEnthalpy,4:ElectronicEnthalpy,5:FixedDewPointAndDryBulb,6:DifferentialDryBulbAndEnthalpy,7:NoEconomizer
        _controlAction_: ... Requires an integer.  See ecdict for different values to supply.  Supply nothing and it defaults to "ModulateFlow"
        _maximumAirFlowRate_: ... supply nothing and it will Autosize (recommended)
        _minimumAirFlowRate_: ... do nothing and it will Autosize (recommended)
        _minimumLimitType_: ... do nothing and it defaults to Proportional Minimum (min depends on the supply air flow rate as opposed to an absolute number)
        _minimumOutdoorAirSchedule_: ... This is a schedule with values between 0 and 1, and it is multiplied by the minimumAirFlowRate.  It is usually left blank, but can be used to fine tune the economizer during warm-up time or after hours.
        _minimumOutdoorAirFracSchedule_: ... this overrides minOutdoorAirSchedule and minAirflowRate.  It is a schedule between 0 and 1.  It is often used to create a 100% outside air system.
        _maximumOutdoorAirFracSchedule_: ... this is a schedule between 0 and 1.  It is often used to create a recirculating outside air system such as that in patient rooms.
        _maximumLimitDewpoint_: ... needed for when the ControlType is Fixed Dewpoint and Dry Bulb.  Otherwise leave blank
        _sensedMinimum_: ... is the minimum of whatever the control type, at this point the system goes to minimum flow
        _sensedMaximum_: ... is the maximum of whatever the control type, at this point the system goes to minimum flow
        _economizerLockoutMethod_: ... should only used when the HVAC system is packaged DX
        _timeOfDaySchedule_: this field is only used when the outdoor flow rate is based on a schedule.  It is rare for a normal economizer to have this value set.  If so, apply the name of a schedule.
        _mechVentController_: an optional field, though highly recommended.  Open Studio provides default behavoir for this controller.
        _availabilityManagerList_ : allows you to toggle between different AvailabilityManagers.  Right now, we simply allow you to create a list that has only one AvailabilityManager, and the type of manager can be ScheduledOrNightCycle
    Returns:
        airsideEconomizer: An airside economizer detail that can be plugged into the "Honeybee_Air Handling Unit Detail" component.
