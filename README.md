Honeybee for Grasshopper
========================================
Honeybee connects Grasshopper3D to EnergyPlus, Radiance, Daysim and OpenStudio for building energy and daylighting simulation.The Honeybee project intends to make many of the features of these simulation tools available in a parametric way.

You need to have [Ladybug](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Ladybug) installed in order to run Honeybee.
