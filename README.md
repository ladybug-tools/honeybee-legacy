[Pollination](http://mostapharoudsari.github.io/Honeybee/Pollination)
========================================
[Pollination](http://mostapharoudsari.github.io/Honeybee/Pollination) [Vis] is a web-based application for exploring multi-dimensional data. [Pollination](http://honeypatch.github.io/pollination/index) started at the [AEC-TECH Hackathon](http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/aec-technology-symposium-2014/aec-technology-symposium-2014-hackathon/). Many thanks to the [team members](http://honeypatch.github.io/pollination/team). Also many thanks to [Kai Chang](https://github.com/syntagmatic) for developing [parcoords](https://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel-coordinates/) library for [D3JS](http://d3js.org/). Creating Pollination would be very hard without his development.

Pollination visualizes structured .csv and .json files. You can use Honeybee to generate the files or create them manually.
